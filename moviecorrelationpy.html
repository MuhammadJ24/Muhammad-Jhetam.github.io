									<h1>Movie Industry Correlation<br />
									in Python using Pandas</h1>
									<p>In this project movie industry data between the years 1980 and 2020 <br/> 
										was cleaned, prepared and the analysed for correlations between fields using the
                                        python libraries: Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and numpy.
                                    </p>

								<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
								<p> The  Movie dataset used in this project was obtained on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle.com</a>.
									 The actual dataset that was used can be found here, 
									<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies" target="_blank"> Movie Industry Dataset</a>.
								<br>
								</p>
								The code base for this project can also be found in my 
									<a href="https://github.com/MuhammadJ24/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/MovieCorrelation.ipynb" target="_blank">Github Repository</a>.
								<br>

								<br>
								<h2>Preparation</h2>
								<br>

								<h3>Imports</h3>
								<p>	
								The first step of this project was to import all of the Python Libraries needed into the Jupyter Notebook we're using.
								I also added some lines of code to configure and set the style of the plots that will be created at the analysis stage in this project.
								The final part of our initial step is to import the dataset that will be used. 
								</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><script src="https://gist.github.com/MuhammadJ24/df27cbce5491efa78be900d9f21c777c.js"></script></div>
								<br>

								<h3>First Inspection</h3>
								<p> It is always good practise to have inspect at your dataset after importing it into python. Here we visually inspect for any,
									<i>Nulls</i>, errors or inconsistencies, etc., in the data so that we know how to clean the dataset. 
									<br>Below is a preview of our initial dataset.
								</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><script src="https://gist.github.com/MuhammadJ24/5914c8ad608199644ceef0a05a184066.js"></script></div>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><img  src="images/datapreview_movies.JPG" style='max-width:100%;height:auto;' alt="" /></div>
								<br>

								<br>
								<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
								<br>
								<h3>Checking/Removing Null entries</h3>
								<p> In the case of this project, movies that had <i>Null</i> entries were not considered to ensure an 
									accurate correlation analysis between them. Before removing these rows of data we first need
									to check if they even exist. The percentage of <i>Null</i> entries in each column of our initial dataset
									is shown below. 
								</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><script src="https://gist.github.com/MuhammadJ24/64d3be18e87d3ba90c78966d02a87f35.js"></script></div>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><img  src="images/checknulls_movies.JPG" style='max-width:100%;height:auto;' alt="" /></div>
								<br>
								<p>These <i>Null</i> entries were then removed from the dataset. After which we run check
								to see if the removal was indeed successful. </p>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><script src="https://gist.github.com/MuhammadJ24/c9dd99d061855c97f1ee910c56fc9e7a.js"></script></script></div>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><img  src="images/dropnulls_movies.JPG" style='max-width:100%;height:auto;' alt="" /></div>
								<br>
							
								
								<h3>Standardization of Data</h3>
								<p> It was observed that the <i>budget</i>,<i>gross</i> and <i>votes</i> columns in our datset were
									formatted as the <i>float64</i> data type with a single decimal place of <i>.0</i> at the end of each entry.
									However, none of these columns contained a <i>float64</i> value that had a decimal other than
									<i>0</i>, which means the decimals are not needed. Therefore, these columns were converted into the <i>int64</i> to drop the unnecessary
									decimals and save storage space(however small the difference, it is a good practise).   
								</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><script src="https://gist.github.com/MuhammadJ24/0d393af73db807e2f3e0381c31e5531b.js"></script></div>
								<br>


								<h3>Checking for and removing Duplicates</h3>
								<p> The dataset was then checked for duplicate entries, of which there were none.
								</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><script src="https://gist.github.com/MuhammadJ24/ca9d06d1169dd89e87c835ab8c91fc21.js"></script></div>
								<br>

								<h3>Dataset ordering</h3>
								<p> 
									The last step in the data cleaning/preparation phase of the project was to order the movies in our data
									in decending order of their gross earnings. This makes our analysis in the next phase simpler.
									The 5 highest grossing movies in the dataset can be seen below.
								</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><script src="https://gist.github.com/MuhammadJ24/c9a5d6dc1da9f39bc3bc0fed4c03a4f9.js"></script></div>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><img  src="images/sort_movies.JPG" style='max-width:100%;height:auto;' alt="" /></div>
								<br>

								<br>
								<h2>Analysis</h2>
								<br>
								<p>
									The code for this section is not shown, but can be found here: 	 
									<a href="https://github.com/MuhammadJ24/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/MovieCorrelation.ipynb" target="_blank">Github Repository</a>.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Budget vs. Gross Earnings</h3>
								<p> 
									The budget to make a movie and the gross earnings of that movie
									 have a strong correlation. That was the first hypothesis analysed in this project.
									 To do this, the <i>budget</i> and <i>gross</i> fields of the dataset were plotted 
									 against each other.
								</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><img  src="images/bvg_movies.JPG" style='max-width:100%;height:auto;' alt="" /></div>
								<br>
								<p>
									Based of this graphic there seems to be a correlation between the movie's budget and 
									its earnings. However, let us confirm this with a regression plot.
								</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><img  src="images/regplt_movies.JPG" style='max-width:100%;height:auto;' alt="" /></div>
								<br>
								<p>
									As can be seen there is clearly a fairly strong correlation between the movie's budget and 
									its gross earnings. The higher the budget, the higher the earnings of the movie tends to be.
									<br>
									<br>
									The correlation between a movie's budget and it gross earnings make sense, in that the a higher budget 
									may be linked to movie having a better cast, equipment, special effects(if required), better filming locations and even better
									the creation of better scenes in the case of adventure, action and other movies related to those. 
								</p>


								<h3>General Correlation</h3>
								<p> 
									In this section, a correlation matrix was used to comapre all "numerical" type entries
									in the dataset against each other, to look for any correlations between them.
								</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><img  src="images/cormatrix_movies.JPG" style='max-width:100%;height:auto;' alt="" /></div>
								<br>

								<p>
									In the above table, there is a fairly strong correlation between the <i>budget</i>
									and <i>gross</i> of each movie, as seen earlier. <br>
									<br>
									There is also a moderately strong correlation between the <i>gross</i> and <i>votes</i> of each movie.
									This is an unsuprising trend, the <i>votes</i> are an idication of a positive response from 
									the general viewer. It makes sense that the more <i>votes</i> a movie receives from fans, the higher the earnings 
									of the movie tends to be. <br>
									<br>
									Interestingly, the correlation matrix shows that there is a moderately weak correlation
									between the fans <i>votes</i> and the rating <i>score</i> given by movie critics. This means that the rating <i>score</i> 
									of a movie given by critics does not have a strong impact on whether or not fans vote for the movie, i.e, they think that its good. <br>
									<br>
									The rating <i>score</i> given to movie also has a very weak correlation to the gross earnings
									of the movie, it can be said that the rating <i>score</i> of a movie has little, to no impact on its earnings

								</p>
								
								<h3>Highest Grossing companies</h3>
								<p> 
									For last part of our analysis, I found the <i>Top 10 Grossing Companies</i> from 
									1980 to 2020.
								</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;"><img  src="images/top_companies_movies.JPG" style='max-width:100%;height:auto;' alt="" /></div>
								<br>
								<p> 
									There is an extremely large gap in revenue between the most successful companies and companies lower on this list. 

								</p>


								<h3>Final Remarks</h3>
								<p>This project required a variety of data cleaning and preparation techniques in python, before
									allowing us to perform an analysis on the movie industry, which yielded valuable insight on
									correlations between factors surrounding movies and their grossings. <br>
									The <i>Budget</i> and <i>Viwer approval</i> of a movie tend to be its biggest contributors
									to it being a high grossing movie. <br>
									It was also found that the <i>Critic Rating Score</i> does not have a strong influence
									on its grossings. <br>
									<br>
